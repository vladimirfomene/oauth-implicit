# Developing And Securing A Resource Server With Spring Boot Oauth And Auth0

**TL:DR:** An introduction to the article giving a brief summary of the what the article
will focus us.

## Prerequisites
Softwares you need to install to follow the tutorial:
* Jdk 10 or below
* Any text editor or IDE of your choice, though I recommend Intellij
* An Auth0 account

## What is Oauth?

## What is the Oauth Implicit flow?

## Securing a resource server with Oauth
* Create the API on Auth0
* Use Spring Boot to create a local resource server.
* Configure security and authorization with your Auth0 credentials.

## Accessing the resource server
* Develop an SPA to get access tokens from Auth0
* Develop operations for accessing the resource server in the SPA.

## Testing
* Test all the resource server's endpoints to demonstrate that the resources which are secured can only be accessed with an access token.
* Also demonstrate that all the resources that are public can be accessed without an access token.

## Conclusion
