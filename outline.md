# Securing SPAs and Spring Boot APIs with the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant

**TL:DR:** An introduction to the article giving a brief summary of the what the article
will focus us.

## Prerequisites
Softwares you need to install to follow the tutorial:
* JDK 10 (and 11?)
* Any text editor or IDE of your choice, though I recommend Intellij

## What is OAuth 2.0?

## What is the OAuth 2.0 Implicit flow?

## Securing Spring Boot with OAuth 2.0
*  Create the API on Auth0
* Mention that readers will need an OAuth 2.0 implementation (Auth0 in this case)
* Tell readers to sign up.
* Tell readers to create an Auth0 Application and an Auth0 API.
* Use https://start.spring.io to scaffold a new app.
* Install dependencies
* Develop the Spring Boot API endpoints
* Secure the Spring Boot API with OAuth/Auth0

## Creating and Securing a SPA with the Implicit Grant
* Develop an SPA to get access tokens from Auth0
* Develop operations for accessing the resource server in the SPA.

## Testing
* Test all the resource server's endpoints to demonstrate that the resources which are secured can only be accessed with an access token.
* Also demonstrate that all the resources that are public can be accessed without an access token.

## Conclusion
